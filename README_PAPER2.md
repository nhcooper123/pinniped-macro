- Data used in the analyses for the paper
    1. *median_tree.tre*. This is the tree used as a starting point for all the diversification rate and biogeography analyses.

- Diversification dynamics analyses
    1. *pinniped_median_full.tre* - full phylogeny.
    1. *pinniped_median_extant.tre* - phylogeny with only extant taxa.  
    1. *pinniped_median_fossil.tre* - phylogeny with only fossil taxa.
    1. *pinniped_median_noanc.tre* - full phylogeny but with sampled ancestors removed.
    1. *pinniped_median_fossil_noanc.tre* - phylogeny with only fossil taxa but with sampled ancestors removed.

- Biogeography
    1. *pinniped-tree-all_9areas.tre* - full phylogeny for taxa in the biogeography analyses.       
    1. *pinniped-tree-extant_9areas.tre* - phylogeny for extant taxa in the biogeography analyses.
    1. *pinniped-tree-fossil_9areas.tre* - phylogeny for fossil taxa in the biogeography analyses.
    1. *pinniped-all-geography_9areas.txt* - geography file for all taxa in the biogeography analyses.
    1. *pinniped-extant-geography_9areas.txt* - geography file for extant taxa in the biogeography analyses.
    1. *pinniped-fossil-geography_9areas.txt* - geography file for fossil taxa in the biogeography analyses.
    1. *timeperiods-all_9areas.txt* - file defining the time periods for time stratified analyses.
    1. *pinniped_areas_new_GB_phylip-JRule_edit-nocomments.txt* - raw geography data.
    1. *DEC-all-node-probabilities.csv* - marginal probabilities of all states at each node in the full tree, under the DEC model.
    1. *DECJ-all-node-probabilities.csv* - marginal probabilities of all states at each node in the full tree, under the DEC+J model.
