% Table of unlikely results
\begin{longtable}{cccccc}

\caption{Results of model fits from BioGeoBEARS analysis for pinnipeds. Impossible and unlikely area-combinations were excluded (see text). DEC = dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis; DEC + J = DEC model with jump dispersal; lnL = log-likelihood values; AICc = sample-size corrected Akaike information criterion; d = dispersal rate (range expansion) along each branch within the phylogeny; e = extinction rate (range contraction) along each branch within the phylogeny; j, relative weight of jump dispersal in each model.
